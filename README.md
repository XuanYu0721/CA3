EU countries Economic Data Explorer
Overview
This web application allows users to explore economic data for different EU cities, utilizing data from "global_economy.csv" and "eu_countries.csv" as open-source databases.

Design
The application's design includes two main pages: "index.html" for displaying cities and "show.html" for showing detailed economic data of the selected city.

Development
The application is developed using the Flask framework and SQLite database. It includes scripts like "parse_csv.py" for processing CSV data and "economic_data.py" for handling Flask routes and database interactions.
